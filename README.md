Our Anti-Sleep Detection System employs an eye blink sensor to monitor driver alertness, triggering alerts upon detecting signs of drowsiness to prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
Title: Anti-Sleep Detection System with Eye Blink Sensor

Description:
Our Anti-Sleep Detection System is a crucial tool designed to prevent accidents caused by driver fatigue. Utilizing an eye blink sensor, this system constantly monitors the driver's alertness levels. Once signs of drowsiness are detected through prolonged eye closure, the system triggers an alert mechanism, helping to awaken the driver and avert potential disasters.

The system's operation is simple yet effective. An eye blink sensor is connected to a microcontroller, which continuously checks for changes in the sensor's output. When a blink is detected, a timer is initiated, measuring the duration of the blink. If the blink persists beyond a predefined threshold, indicative of potential drowsiness, an alert mechanism is activated. In this implementation, a buzzer is employed to provide an audible alert to the driver, prompting them to regain focus and attentiveness.

By leveraging this system, drivers can enhance their safety on the road by mitigating the risks associated with fatigue-induced accidents. Additionally, this project serves as an educational resource, offering insights into the integration of sensor technology with microcontrollers for real-world applications.

This project is open-source and available on GitHub, encouraging collaboration and innovation within the community. Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt the code to suit your specific requirements or integrate additional features for enhanced functionality. Together, let's strive towards safer roads and heightened awareness behind the wheel.
